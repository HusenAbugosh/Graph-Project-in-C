# Graph-Project-in-C
Project 4 in Data structure course 

In this project, we will implement Dijkstra’s and Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithms to find the shortest path between two cities.

we will read the data from the given file cities.txt 
and then construct the shortest path between a given city (input from the user) and a destination city (input from the user). 

we will print the full path using both algorithms and the total distance for Dijkstra’s algorithm.

The menu should include the following information:
1. Load cities: loads the file and construct the graph
2. Enter source: read the source city
3. Enter destination: print the full route of the shortest path including the distance between each two cities and the total shortest cost for both algorithms (Dijkstra and BFS)
4. Exit: prints the information of step 3 to a file called shortest_distance.txt and exits the program
